# Numerology
This is a fun piece of JS code that takes in a Javascripted array of names, and filters out all the ones which (by default) have the numerological value of 22.

Numerology is a devisive topic; no scientific proof exists that backs up the claims made by its supporters. Yet, in some belief systems, numerology is a very popular way of determining any number of life factors - those of loved ones, people you know, events, the ideal time of conception.

Two reasons exist for this repository; the first is that I wanted a playground within which to expand my knowledge of Javascript, best practices, that sort of thing. Secondly, was that I learned about numerology from a recently passed away acquaintance of mine. He worked as a nurse in Malaysia, but was well versed in Indian Astrology, from which this particular 'strand' of numerology is based. I'm no 'expert' on numerology, and have merely based my particular alphabet numerology on a chart that he passed on. On the proviso that the code is used for informational and entertainment purposes, I hope you enjoy looking over it.

At present, it relies on the jQuery library, merely for HTML list population. This can easily be replaced in the future. The code originally lived as a JSFiddle, but it made more sense to move it to a repo, so revisions could be tracked better.

The JS code is annotated, something I intend to keep as much as possible.

I'm certainly interested in seeing what the ES6 specification can bring in terms of further code amends, any suggestions about this or anything code related are welcome.
